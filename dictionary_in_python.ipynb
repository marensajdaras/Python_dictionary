    "Arrays are a collections of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.\n",
    "Association mean a connection or relationship between things.\n",
    "Associative arrays are basically objects where indexes are replaced by user-defined keys. They do not have a length property like a normal array and cannot be traversed using a normal for loop. When I say normal array I mean lists or tuples.\n",
    "Python does not have build-in support for arrays, so everything I said above you must use it as a description for what I am going to explain now.\n",
    "But Python provide lists, that are arrays indeed. (Lists = Arrays)\n",
    "In computer science, an associative array is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key,value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.\n",
    "So in this collection we have only one key, keys are unique.\n",
